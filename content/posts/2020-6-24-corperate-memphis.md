Even if you haven't, the style may look familiar.
[100s (1000s?) of organizations use the same style](https://www.are.na/claire-l-evans/corporate-memphis).

This [Quartz article](https://qz.com/quartzy/1728767/why-editorial-illustrations-look-so-similar-these-days/) elaborates more on the trend:

> It’s most widely referred to as “flat illustration” or, pejoratively, “Corporate Memphis,” alluding to its frequent appearance in ads and interfaces for tech companies like Lyft, Spotify, Oscar, Airtable, and many others.

> How did this style come to define today’s illustration practice?  The answer boils down to three T’s: technology, taste, and terrible pay.

Once you notice the style, you'll see it everywhere.

Since working from home, I've been using an external monitor more heavily.
The light in my office changes throughout the day, and I found myself adjusting the brightness on my Macbook and external monitor separately.

I started looking for a utility that would link the brightness of the MBP and my external monitor, and I found [Lunar](https://lunar.fyi/).

In sync mode, the brightness of the laptop and external monitor are linked, which means I only need to adjust one brightness level for both.

It's neat, you should try it.
